# TikTok FPS Bypasser (Forked Version)

This project is a fork of [LuisAlves10/TikTok-FPS-Compression-Bypasser](https://github.com/LuisAlves10/TikTok-FPS-Compression-Bypasser) with improvements for GUI usability and FPS display. It allows modifying MP4 files to bypass TikTok's FPS restrictions by patching the `mvhd` and `mdhd` atoms.

## Features in This Fork

- Added **GUI mode** with file browsing and output folder selection.
- Displays **input FPS** and **output FPS** in real-time.
- Color-coded FPS warnings:
- Warns dynamically if output FPS may cause lag.
- CLI mode still supported for scripting and automation.
